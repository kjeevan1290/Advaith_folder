Other services
====================

1)cloud formation - we can upload the yaml file to create the ec2 instances and all configurtion to other aws services.
                    we can update the stack by uploading a new yaml so that it will add additional services
  
  a) Application composer - we can desing the graph - like drag and drop all the aws services and connect them with other services.
  
2) SES - amazon simple email service 

3) Amazon pinpoint - email, SMS, push, voice, and in-app messaging

4) Systems Manager – SSM Session Manager - 
     Allows you to start a secure shell on your EC2 and 
     on-premises server
    • No SSH access, bastion hosts, or SSH keys needed to connect to ec2 instances
	• No port 22 needed (better security)
	• Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows
	* useful to connect across all accounts

5) cost explorer - • Analyze your data at a high level: total costs and usage across all accounts 
                   • Or Monthly, hourly, resource level granularity
				   
				   

6) Origin Access Control (OAC) - in AWS refers to a security mechanism used to control access to a content origin (such as an Amazon S3 bucket) when serving content through Amazon CloudFront. 
It ensures that only CloudFront can access the content stored in the origin, protecting it from direct public access.				   
						
						
7) ACLs (Access Control Lists) in AWS are primarily associated with Amazon S3 for managing access to buckets and objects. 
However, ACLs are also used in other AWS services, such as:
 Network ACLs: These are used in Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) to control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
                Network ACLs act as a stateless firewall, evaluating traffic based on rules defined within them2.
 AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall): ACLs can be used to create rules that allow, block, or count web requests based on conditions 
                                     that you specify, such as IP addresses or query strings.
									 
8) In AWS, an Access Control List (ACL) is a mechanism used to manage access to resources like S3 buckets and objects. Here are some key points about ACLs in AWS:
Resource Attachment: Each bucket and object in Amazon S3 has an ACL attached to it as a subresource.
Purpose: ACLs define which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access (e.g., read, write) to a resource1.
Permissions: ACLs allow you to grant specific permissions to other AWS accounts or predefined groups. For example, you can grant read access to a specific user or group2.
Default Settings: By default, the owner of the bucket or object has full control. You can modify the ACL to grant additional permissions2.
Modern Use: Many modern use cases no longer require ACLs, as access management policies can be used instead. AWS recommends disabling ACLs unless you need to control access for each object individually.
